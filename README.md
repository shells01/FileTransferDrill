This is a repository for my Python drills. 

<b>Datetime Drill</b> (datetime_drill.py)
Scenario: A company has opened 2 new branches, one in New York City, and the other in London. They need a simple program to find out if the branches are open or closed based on the current time of the Headquarters here in Portland. The hours of both branches 9:00 am - 9:00 pm in their own time zones.

Task: Create code that will use the current time of the Portland HQ to find out the time in the NYC & London branches, then compare that time with the branches' hours to see if they are open or closed. 
Print out if each of the branches are open or closed.
- Use Datetime module
- Use Python 2.7
